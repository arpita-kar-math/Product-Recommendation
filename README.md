# Product-Recommendation

This project involved working on transaction data from an ecommerce grocery orders of a retail store. 

At first, we build a baseline recommendation model based on co-purchase frequency. 

Then we use build a pure collaborative filtering model using LightFM library.

“LightFM is a Python implementation of a number of popular recommendation algorithms for both implicit and explicit feedback, including efficient implementation of BPR and WARP ranking losses. It’s easy to use, fast (via multithreaded model estimation), and produces high quality results.”- LightFm Documentation. (https://github.com/lyst/lightfm)

All the steps and explanations are recoreded in the notebook in this repository.
